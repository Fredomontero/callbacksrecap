    <h2>What does synchronous and asynchronous means?</h2>
    <p>
        Async is short for "asynchronous". It's easier to understand async if you first understand what "synchronous" means.
        In programming, we can simplify the definition of synchronous code as "a bunch of statements in sequence"; so each statement
        in your code is executed one after the other. This means each statement has to wait for the previous one to finish executing.
        <br><br>
        console.log('First');<br>
        console.log('Second');<br>
        console.log('Third');<br>
        <br><br>
        The statements above will execute in order outputting "First", "Second", "Third" to the console. That's because it's written synchronously.
        Asynchronous code takes statements outside of the main flow, allowing the code after asynchronous call to be executed inmediately without waiting. you've
        probably used asynchronous programming before with ajax or something.
        <br><br>
        console.log('First');<br>
        jQuery.get("page.html", function(data){<br>
            console.log('Second');<br>
        });<br>
        console.log('Third');<br>
        <br><br>
        In the example above, the output will be different: "First","Third", "Second". this is because the function passed into jQuery.get is not called inmediately
        it has to wait for jQuery to fetch the page you asked for before it can execute.
        <i>"So why the hell use asynchronous code instead of synchronous code?"</i> I hear you ask! I'll explain.

    <h2>Why Asynchronous?</h2>
    <p>
        When JavaScript is executed, sychronous code has potential to block futher execution until it has finished what is doing, In english, long-running JavaScript
        functions can make UI or server unresponsive until the function has returned. Obviously this can result in a terrible user-experience. <br>
        For example: if you want to load your latest tweets onto a webpage, and you do this synchronously, then a visitor to your site won't be able to do anything
        until those tweets are loaded. This could cause a long delay before they even get to see the content of your site! I've illustrated the problem below: <br>
        Example 1: <br>
        <br><br>
        tweets = loadTweetsSync(); <br>
        // ...wait<br>
        // ...Do something with the tweets <br>
        doOtherImportantThings();<br>
        <br><br>
        loadTweetsAsync(function(){ <br>
        // ...wait<br>
        // ...Do something with the tweets <br>
        }); <br>
        doOtherImportantThings();<br>
        <br><br>
        In the second example , doSomeOtherImportant Things doesn't have to wait for the tweets to load.
